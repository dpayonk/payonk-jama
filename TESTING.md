## Happy path

When a user enters email and confirms through magic, we should direc them to the feed
    enter email
    onredirect of magic
    create profile (validats in backend)
    displays intro to Feed (via Login?)


## Sad path

When a user logs out from their magic account,
    you can no longer access stuff (so JWT invalidated or cleared?)
